    <h2>Projects Overview</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my projects page, where you can explore my past and current projects. As a developer, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, including web applications, mobile apps, and games. My projects cover a variety of technologies, from front-end frameworks like React and React Native to back-end technologies like Node.js and ASP.Net. I believe in creating high-quality, user-friendly projects that solve real-world problems, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge. Take a look at my projects below to see what I've been working on!</p>
