    <h2>Hey</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website, where you can explore my skills and experience as a software engineer. I recently graduated from college with a degree in computer science and am now looking for opportunities to put my skills to use in the industry. My portfolio showcases some of the projects I've worked on during my studies, as well as some personal projects that I've developed on my own time. As a software engineer, I am passionate about writing clean, efficient, and well-structured code, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn and grow. In addition to my technical skills, I also have strong communication and problem-solving skills that I believe are essential for success in this field. Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
